# Data Bootcamp Final Project
**Author:** Shawn Shi

## Overview
This project analyzes consumer electronics shopping behavior using survey data from the United States.  
The goal is to predict whether a customer is more likely to shop **online** or **offline**, and to interpret the results from a marketing perspective.

## Data
The dataset is sourced from Dewey Data and includes demographic information, shopping behavior, and online activity.  
The target variable is `SHOP_ONLINE`.

Due to GitHub file size limits, the cleaned dataset is not included in this repository.  
The data was accessed through Google Drive in Google Colab.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Customer clustering (k = 3)  
- Cluster-specific prediction models (logistic regression and tree-based models)
